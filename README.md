# UnitConverter
Unit Converter with GUI

This is a simple Python app I built to convert between all sorts of units. You could convert from kilometers to miles, teaspoons to milliliters, or even Celsius to Fahrenheit. Itâ€™s got a clean GUI powered by tkinter, so you can just pick your desired unit, type in a value, and get the results. I wanted something practical and expandable, that showed my skills and abilities.
